* .emacs
	These are my personal .emacs files, copying is encouraged, but not expected.
	Use as your ~/.emacs.d and ensure that no ~/.emacs file exists (or that it calls init.el).

*** Licence
   Some of this is obviously not my own, nor do I claim anything outside of *init.el* as mine.
   As far as I know it's all free to share. I take no responsibility. Ever.
