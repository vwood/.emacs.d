* .emacs
These are my personal .emacs files, copying is encouraged, but not expected.
The repo is intented to be ~/.emacs.d any ~/.emacs file will shadow the init.el, so if one exists it should load init.el.

First time start-up will take a while as el-get downloads all the packages it can.

*** Licence
   Some of this is obviously not my own, nor do I claim anything outside of *init.el* as mine.
   As far as I know it's all free to share. I take no responsibility. Ever.
